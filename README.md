# playlister

This program is meant to generate a randomized .m3u playlist from a RadioDJ database running locally on the same machine, ideally to be fed back into RadioDJ's Auto DJ function for continuous on-air play. It currently takes a single string argument which is the genre the playlist's songs will be pulled from.

The functionality of this program is presumably very limited because each RadioDJ user defines their own genres and the backend picks an int value which represents that genre within the program. Thus, each iteration of this program would have to be personalized in order to account for different song library structures.

This repo is therefore more for me to keep track of its progress and have backups for when things get rough ;)
